## Context
In a messaging company, the sales team is in need of assistance with customer information. They often need to understand the distribution of their customers' message sends by carrier. Currently, they extract data from a Business Intelligence team's dashboard and perform calculations in spreadsheets to accomplish this task.

The Brazil team has requested if it would be possible to automate this process in some way, as they were spending too much time on it and the numbers were often unreliable.

## Features:
